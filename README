knurl
=====

A Python module for managing web app state in URLs

Given a structure for the possible states, knurl allows parsing and
building compact URLs for any particular state, and also any
decoposition of the state for use in form fields.

It works by representing the app state as a tree whose leaves are
lists of string variables.  A tree can be separated into a list of
sparse trees or subtrees which can be combined in a html form
submission to compose a page state in a flexible way.

Reserved URL characters ',' ';' '(' ')' '=' are used to delimit
strings in the url.


It works with Python versions 2.7 or 3.

To install, run 'python setup.py install' from the root directory.

The tests can be run with nose: run the 'nosetests' command in the
root directory.
